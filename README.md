## 🧠 AI Logic – Minimax Algorithm

The AI opponent is powered by the **Minimax algorithm**, a classic decision-making technique used in two-player turn-based games like Tic-Tac-Toe. It evaluates all possible future moves and selects the one that minimizes its potential loss while maximizing its chances to win.

This ensures that the AI plays optimally and is very hard to beat!
